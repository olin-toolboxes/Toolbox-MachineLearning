1. What is the general trend in the curve?

	As the percentage of data used for tarining increases, the accuracy on test set is improved.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noiser than others? Why?

	The end part of graph (extremley small or large portion for training) is noiser than the middle part (training ~ 0.5).
	When the tested or trained portin is not enough, there might be some exceptionall cases, which induces some noise of graph.

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

	When I tried for 100 times, it was able to get a smooth curve. (image attatched)

4. Try different values for C. What happens?

	As C is larger, the accurancy on test sets is well improved.
