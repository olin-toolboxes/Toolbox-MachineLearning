Write-up:

1. What is the general trend in the curve?

   The graphs generated by plotting accuracy over percentage training make an
   approximately linear line or a gradual decay of change in accuracy for
   data training.


2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?

   The graph seems to spike up at around 40 and 60 percent and sharply drop
   off immediately after when 10 trials are run. When the number of trials run
   is higher, the graph still fluctuates around the middle section.
   This might be a result of the algorithm adapting to specific features of the
   training info and then having to unlearn it afterwards because it is not
   representative of any actual number.


3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

   50 trials gives a pretty smooth curve, but 100 trials makes it very smooth.
   More than 100 would make it smoother, but not by much.


4. Try different values for C. What happens?

   Decreasing the C value makes the line very unpredictable and the accuracy
   drops quickly. Increasing the C value makes the curve look more and more
   like the graph of a square root but mostly maintains the accuracy.
